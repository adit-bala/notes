# Change of Base

### Higher Base to Lower

1. convert to lower base
2. drop leading 0's

#### ex.

6550_* _> ?_2

1. 110101101000
2. no leading zeros to drop

### Lower Base to Higher

1. chunk up in terms of higher base# of bits
2. convert to higher base

#### ex. 

111111000010_2 -> ?_16

1. 1111 1100 0010
2. F C 2

# Number Representation

1. check if number can be represented in range of values
2. take number (mod highest possible value) and convert to whatever

#### ex. -60 from decimal to unsigned binary

# Overflow

1. if subtraction, convert second number to negative
2. add both numbers
3. if negative, invert bits and add one to find magnitude of number and back -1
